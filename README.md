# Image Filter Application Using OpenCV

This project demonstrates applying different filters to an image using OpenCV and Python. It includes sharpening and embossing effects to enhance and transform images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)
  
## Features

- **Sharpening**: Enhances the details and edges of the image.
- **Embossing**: Creates a 3D effect that emphasizes texture.

## Usage

1. Update the file path for the image in the code.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python image_filtering.py

3. The original, sharpened, and embossed images will be displayed side by side.
